# ExpenseShare_CAMS_Asessment
The problem statement involves designing a simple application flow with wire frames for a group of 5 friends who are going on a 2-day trip. The app should help them manage their expenses during the trip.
## Problem Statement

*A group of 5 friends (A, B, C, D, E) go on a 2-day trip.'C' handles the travel booking for the group.Accommodation is booked by B.Food is shared in groups where 'A' paid for A, B, C. E paid for D and herself.Design a simple app for a group to be able to manage their expenses of the trip. The expectation is to include the following sections:*
       
       • Summarize your version of understanding the problem statement
       • Process flow diagram/User journey along with feature list on App
       • Wireframes for the app
       • Simplistic excel grid for the example showing how the data will be stored and tracked to closure.
## My Outlook

### *Designing an app called "ExpenseShare" to help a group of 5 friends manage their expenses during a 2-day trip to any destination. The friends, Ram, Tom, Raj, Dan, and Amir , have different responsibilities for the trip. For E.g ‘Raj' handles travel booking, ‘Tom' takes care of accommodation, and food expenses are shared among the group. ‘Ram' pays for himself Tom, and Raj, while ‘Amir' pays for Dan and himself.* 

### *And the app allows users to onboard, create and modify trip groups, enter expenses, upload receipts, tag relevant group members for each expense, facilitate payback to selected members, and ultimately close the group when all expenses are equally split and reconciled.*
